                    I built a quick one pager because on your contact form you asked applicants to be creative and say something that catches your eye. Well I took that literally and, well um ... here we are :)

                Well to be quite frank with you reader, I want to be able to work with some really smart people. I don’t mean to pander or anything, but it seems like you guys are a magnet for talented folks.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I’m also passionate about learning what it means to craft an engaging user experience across different media. Building stuff and creating something out of nothing is incredibly intoxicating. That’s why I want to help contribute to your product in any way I can.

<!-- What can I bring -->

                A bit about me, I’m a twenty year old designer/developer (I like doing both) with a business degree (weird mix, I know). I love anything related to UX, UI, user-anything, and I'm getting pretty fluent in different technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, Wordpress and other accompanying stuff). I also recently bought a Google cardboard (experimenting with VR stuff).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I’m going to be upfront with you on this even though I’ve probably consumed enough material for half a lifetime through podcasts and books I still have a LOT to learn. I’ve just finished two internships (done in tandem) one of which was a UX role and the other an engineering role. Both have given me pretty different experiences. I learnt how to speak with engineers as well as be one. I learnt the ‘why’ behind certain design decisions, and at the other end I learnt the ‘how’.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                So I guess what I really bring is a raw passion for making stuff.

                If you’ve come aacross <a href="www.justinfarrugia.com">my portfolio</a> you’ll probably notice that there's still some work to be done (writing case studies and such) due to pesky NDAs I’ve accrued in both internships and freelancing work (#designerproblems). Anyways I’d love to have a chat if that would be okay. Thanks for taking the time to read through this.
