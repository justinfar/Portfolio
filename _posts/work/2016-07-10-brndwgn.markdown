When BRNDWGN had launched their internship program along with the redesign of their new site, I was telling myself day in day out that I was going to apply. I must have written about six drafts before I decided to remotely do anything. "What if?" was the question that always preceeded some pointless conclusion of why I should hold off from pressing send.

Why the hesitation? Well, you see BRNDWGN was (and still is) THE place to be if you were a creative in Malta. I was always telling myself: "You have to do [insert sideproject here] before they can even consider you". While I still maintain this train of thought, it still felt like I was somewhat at odds with myself. And then I realized something pretty important.

<h2>Doing something about it.</h2>

Not doing anything was holding me back tenfold. So, I grabbed my trusty pencil and pad, and started sketching ideas. I had read about Nina Muffleh some time ago, who went above and beyond by building a website so that she could land a position at Airbnb and get recruiters talking. 

As a self-starter myself, I really respected her drive and commitment as well as her courage. Naturally, I was influenced by her approach. So I went ahead and decided to do the same kind of thing to land that internship. So I built a website and well, <a class="post" href="http://justinmarkfarrugia.github.io/BRNDWGN_Application/">here it is.</a>

<p class="description">A bit of a gimmick, but hey I had fun building it</p>

Admittedly, that one-pager accompanied with a pretty boldly worded email took some courage. I mean it’s not like I knew these guys, I just heard the CEO (Hey Pete) speak at a local meetup and was like “Man these guys seem like they do great work”. Two days after finally pressing send, an  email from the Head of Creative showed up in my inbox. That fourth line was a bit heart-wrenching, but needless I visited the office to have a chat, and was offered an internship.

<h2>Takeaways</h2>
Like many interns on their first day, I had that weird blend of contrasting emotions namely fear, occasional arrogance and a willingness to impress. Throughout my time at the wagon I was exposed to a set of briefs which had to be tackled differently as opposed to how I built stuff alone in my room at my desk. 

After a long day, I never went home to the feeling that I was not so great at using <em> that one </em> tool that almost everyone in the office was so good with. Instead, I sort of kept a log at the back of my mind with the conversations I would have had during a critique or a brainstorming session. Better soft skills, an open mind, and collaboration were a necessity if I was to do well. The most important lesson of all though was this:

<blockquote>
    <h5>Sitting comfortably sipping frappa-something, marvelling at the pixels sitting on that giant screen isn't <em>empathy</em>. Design is a team sport, whenever there are more heads involved, great products usually follow.</h5>
</blockquote>
 
<h2>A parting gift/letter</h2>

As a sort of thank you note to show my appreciation to the team for their support and their patience for when I had way too many questions lined up, I built a sort of blueprint for future wagoneers and/or new hires. You can check that out here.

I'm in no way an authorative figure on design(yet). Naturally, I still have a lot to learn, but this internship was definitely a step in the right direction. As for the future? Well we'll see. Till then have a good day reader!
