Now those two may not seemingly go together like peanut butter and jelly do, but I've learnt a lot from both. That's what mainly drives me — a thirst for knowledge. Not only that but also, how can I help other people <i>with</i> that knowledge.

     Why design? Well, I believe it's a craft that can be leveraged to tackle problems and have a profound effect on people's emotions, experiences and interactions that can go beyond a screen.

<p>I'm hoping that I can find a domain where I can put what I've learnt to the test and continue to pursue innovation for social good. I want to get my hands dirty and tackle problems that go beyond the usual applications sitting on our homescreen begging for our attention, tapping into our endless dopamine reserves.

        In essence, the thing that I do is to help people identify problems within a product so that we can work cohesively towards the creation of a personalized experience. I spend my time researching, talking to people, asking a bunch of questions, prototyping and testing. My admittidely child-like inquisitiveness forces me to be overly-introspective at times and ask why. This helps me understand as well as frame the problem statement so that I can effectively design a solution.

<p>I’m also a self-admitted movie/documentary junkie, astronomy enthusiast and a huge Manchester United fan. I should also mention that I’m an introspective person (I guess) who often spends a lot of time thinking, but I fully embrace the ethos of moving fast and geting stuff done. </p>
