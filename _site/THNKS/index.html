		<h1>To the future wagoneers</h1>
		<hr>
		<article>
			<p>Dear Reader,</p>
			<br>
			<p>To give you some context before you dive in, this is an outgoing wagoneer's advice for future interns and new hires just like yourself. Hopefully by the end of this, you'll be able to prep yourself and get ready for one heck of a ride.</p>
			<br>
			<p>So you've got yourself a position at the WGN. Pat yourself on the back reader! You've done a mighty fine job. But wait, it doesn't stop there. BRND WGN isn't just another agency. I bet you've heard that plenty of times haven't you? Well, get ready to hear it again. They arenâ€™t.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Why? Well I'm glad you asked! Take a good look around you. These people are here not just for the paycheck, they're here because they're gifted problem solvers. During my time here, one particular moment stood out. BRND WGN had just turned ten years old and most of the guys were prepping up stuff for that night's celebrations. Pete (your boss) came rushing to the creative team to solve an issue that needed all hands on deck. In a matter of seconds, he was surrounded by account execs and a bunch of creatives who dropped what they were doing and asked whether they could help. </p>
			<br>
			<p>That to me was an indication, of how passionate this team really is. It isn't just the creatives that are saving the day. It's the account execs managing the interests (and sometimes expectations) of a client. It's the developers who are building cool shit day in day out and wondering why that one stupid stylesheet rule isn't doing anything. It's the traffic manager making sure everything's on track, on time and according to budget.  </p>
			<br>
			<p>It's the super organized content team capable of stringing together sentences rivalling a Shakespearean sonnet. It's the accounting team that makes sure our finances don't end up in the shitter. It's the media team along with the strategy peeps who meticulously research, negotiate and hustle their way towards activation. It's the super helpful office administrator who always greets you with a smile. And then there's Jeremy, who will send you into fits of laughter on more than one occassion with his daily antics.</p> 
			<br>

			<p>Amongst the lessons I've learnt whilst I've been here, I've taken away these in particular:</p>
			<br>
			<ul>
				<li>Don't be afraid to challenge everything, but be nice about it</li>
				<li>Listen to your mentors, they know their stuff</li>
				<li>Work hard and be humble (said every motivational poster ever)</li>
				<li>Be a go-getter, show initiative and take responsibility. Don't sit around waiting for your next assignment</li>
				<li>Talk to everyone, not just your deskmates</li>
			</ul>
			<br>
			<p>Anyways, you get the gist. I consider myself more than lucky to have been a wagoneer even if it was for a short period of time. I have no doubt that your time here will be unforgettable, remember to make the most of it. I wish you the best of luck.</p>
			<br>
			<p>For the love of brands,</p>
