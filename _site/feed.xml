        <title>Intentionality and Empathy: What I learnt from my first design internship</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;
  p &gt; a {

&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When BRNDWGN had launched their internship program along with the redesign of their new site, I was telling myself day in day out that I was going to apply. I must have written about six drafts before I decided to remotely do anything. “What if?” was the question that always preceeded some pointless conclusion of why I should hold off from pressing send.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why the hesitation? Well, you see BRNDWGN was (and still is) THE place to be if you were a creative in Malta. I was always telling myself: “You have to do [insert sideproject here] before they can even consider you”. While I still maintain this train of thought, it still felt like I was somewhat at odds with myself. And then I realized something pretty important.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Doing something about it.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not doing anything was holding me back tenfold. So, I grabbed my trusty pencil and pad, and started sketching ideas. I had read about Nina Muffleh some time ago, who went above and beyond by building a website so that she could land a position at Airbnb and get recruiters talking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a self-starter myself, I really respected her drive and commitment as well as her courage. Naturally, I was influenced by her approach. So I went ahead and decided to do the same kind of thing to land that internship. So I built a website and well, &lt;a class=&quot;post&quot; href=&quot;http://justinmarkfarrugia.github.io/BRNDWGN_Application/&quot;&gt;here it is.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;box&quot; src=&quot;img/BRNDWGN_site.png&quot; alt=&quot;A one-pager I built for my application at BRNDWGN&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;A bit of a gimmick, but hey I had fun building it&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, that one-pager accompanied with a pretty boldly worded email took some courage. I mean it’s not like I knew these guys, I just heard the CEO (Hey Pete) speak at a local meetup and was like “Man these guys seem like they do great work”. Two days after finally pressing send, an  email from the Head of Creative showed up in my inbox. That fourth line was a bit heart-wrenching, but nevertheless I visited the office to have a chat, and was offered an internship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;box&quot; src=&quot;img/BRNDWGNemail.png&quot; alt=&quot;A one-pager I built for my application at BRNDWGN&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;“Definitely one of the most original internship requests I’ve ever received”. Yep, nailed it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;What I took away&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many interns on their first day, I had that weird blend of contrasting emotions namely fear, occasional arrogance and a willingness to impress. Throughout my time at the wagon I was exposed to a set of briefs which had to be tackled differently as opposed to how I built stuff alone in my room at my desk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my very first briefs was to design and build a banner advert that promoted the company’s 10 year anniversary. At first I wasn’t sure that what I was doing, was really UX work per-se. It seemed like a trivial task handed off to an intern, but boy was I wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As an adblock user, I had brought up the ‘why are we actually doing this’ several times and backed up my argument with some numbers about ad viewability and click through rates. &lt;span class=&quot;point&quot;&gt; One thing I fundamentally forgot however was &lt;strong&gt;the user&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;. The person I would be designing for, probably wouldn’t be aware of ad blocking software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;point&quot;&gt;Another thing I learnt was designing with &lt;strong&gt;intentionality&lt;/strong&gt;, especially when I worked on one particular landing page that went through several iterations.&lt;/span&gt; Apart from knowing my audience, setting a success criteria and looking out for conversion metrics, the thing that I needed to be mindful of &lt;span class=&quot;point&quot;&gt; was ultimately, the &lt;strong&gt;purpose&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/span&gt;. If I knew the why when I was tasked with building something, then I could tackle the problem better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a long day, I never went home to the feeling that I was not so great at using that one tool that almost everyone in the office was so good with. Instead, I sort of kept a log at the back of my mind &lt;span class=&quot;point&quot;&gt;with the conversations I would have had&lt;/span&gt; during a critique or a brainstorming session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;point&quot;&gt;Better soft skills, an open mind, and collaboration&lt;/span&gt; were a necessity if I was to do well. The most important lesson of all though was that design was a &lt;strong&gt;team sport&lt;/strong&gt;, whenever there were more heads involved, great products usually followed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A parting gift&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a sort of thank you note to show my appreciation to the team for their support and their patience for when I had way too many questions lined up, I built a sort of blueprint for future wagoneers and/or new hires. You can check that out here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&quot;box&quot; src=&quot;img/THNKS.png&quot; alt=&quot;Building a website to say thanks&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m in no way an authorative figure on design (yet). Naturally, I still have a lot to learn, but this internship was definitely a step in the right direction. As for the future? Well we’ll see. Till then have a good day reader!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Revisting an old project: A necessary redesign</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;
  p &gt; a {
		color: #605CA8;
		padding-bottom: 5px;
		border-bottom: 1px solid #605CA8;
	}

	.box {
		background-color: rgba(16, 133, 249, 0.1);
		color: #605CA8;
		padding: 30px;
		border: 3px solid #605CA8;
	}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;box&quot;&gt;
	I try to document my projects in depth as case studies, so it takes awhile to get these up and running. If you&#39;d like to see specific parts of this project, don&#39;t hesitate to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:justinmfarrugia@gmail.com&quot; style=&quot;color: #605CA8;
		padding-bottom: 5px;
		border-bottom: 3px solid #605CA8;&quot;&gt;contact me &lt;/a&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;A necessary redesign? Pretty bold statement there.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Velit possimus provident deleniti eaque cumque consequuntur ducimus numquam animi harum quos, facilis, quia repellendus quasi, non esse iste fugit dicta quod.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This being the industry that is, the team and I formulated a hypothesis people usually visit a museum website to see imagery therefore the ratio of information to visual imagery had to reflect that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We &lt;em&gt;think&lt;/em&gt; travelers will trust listings more if we improve the visual experience for listings and better equip hosts to showcase their homes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be successful if we can encourage more travelers to book rooms, and for them to feel more comfortable doing so without compromising the host experience. We are limited by the fact that our hosts are not expert curators (most don’t even have professional photos of their homes), so we‘re probably going to need to hire photographers for them at least.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Building a fleet management solution</title>
        <description>&lt;style&gt;
	img {
		border: none;
	}

	h2 {
		line-height: 1.5;
	}
&lt;/style&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This project took place between July 2016 and October 2016. I was a user experience design intern making up a small team that consisted two senior engineers and an engineering intern. I was responsible for initial research, experience design, visual design and some front-end development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, most of the work that will be shown here didn’t get shipped due to reasons that I can’t publicly disclose. What I can tell you however, is that this was one product that definitely needed some love.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Overview&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Open Dispatch is a fleet management application designed to provide mobile teams such as technicians and drivers an intuitive and unobstructive experience with which to carry out their work. Fleet managers, back office managers and workshop operators are also able to view real-time updates of the progress made by field agents.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/opendispatch_overview.png&quot; alt=&quot;Open Dispatch Overview&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;An eagle&#39;s eye view of just a few of the final iterations that we had tested with a number of people. From Top to Bottom: Splashscreen, Sign-Up flow, Pre-Inspection Steps, Home, Jobs, Contacts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;How can we make mobile workers&#39; communication channels with the backoffice more clear?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This was &lt;i&gt;the&lt;/i&gt; problem.  Productivity is critical for a mobile workforce to operate at an optimal level. If the backoffice team and the field agents were not communicating well, then that in itself would be a major headache.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thus, the more connected a workforce is to the business, the more productive they become. This problem is important to solve because if a workforce is not productive, then not only may there be considerable revenue decrease from the business end, but business customers might also opt to switch supplier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR (Here&#39;s what we did, sort of)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/opendispatch_process.png&quot; alt=&quot;Design process I developed together with the team&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;Here&#39;s a very rough overview of the user-centred process I thought we would naturally adopt, or so I thought. Turns out it can never be &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; linear&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Approach&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My lack of domain knowledge in this particular space meant that I needed to dive in, and immerse myself as thoroughly and as quickly as possible. Due to a very limited timeline, I had to resort to good old desk research. That basically translates to having twenty browser tabs open, research articles, blogs a plenty and whatever else I could get my hands on to inform both myself and the product decisions I would eventually make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/CurrentIteration.png&quot; alt=&quot;Usability Test for current iteration&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;We tried to find out current pain points within the existing solution, so that we could see what was and wasn&#39;t working. As can be seen above there were definitely some problems that we needed to address. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I believed that the collective mind is better than the singular mind when it comes to collecting, understanding and then synthesizing research. Sharing every last scrap of information we could find with each other, was essential, as it kind of helped us prepare mentally for the ideation process.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Getting to know our users &lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also made it a point to talk to people before we committed to building anything. I began the process by interviewing six participants to get an idea of how people use exisiting manifestations of fleet management software. Directly talking to people helped me understand the pain points they had, gather context as well as analyze some of their workflows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through talking to people, I came to realize a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;Members of the backoffice had different ways of how they would handle certain tasks with certain field workers, and as such there was no real consistency in procedure&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Solution&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We chose to leverage Google’s Material Design language because as a team we felt that it gives us the comprehensiveness and flexibility we needed, to be able to communicate depth and motion when necessary throughout the different elements and interactions we incorporated into the product.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;../img/OpenDispatch_Android.png&quot; alt=&quot;Open Dispatch Android&quot; style=&quot;border:none;&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;description&quot;&gt;From left to right: The jobs in progress list, the home feed, and the pre-inspection step which happens before users navigate the core functionalities of the app itself &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Takeaways&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately our work never saw the light of day (unless you count the people we had asked to come in for testing). As a result of this I’ve learnt that industries such as this come with a different host of topics, areas and issues that will need to be considered when architecting a solution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was strange. Being exposed to failure this early on in my career was something that I never expected after graduation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pushing the value of design in an area with a lot of friction, whilst mostly being exposed to people designing in the consumer space who were getting much less resistance, was another challenge. But hey, what’s building something without roadblocks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
