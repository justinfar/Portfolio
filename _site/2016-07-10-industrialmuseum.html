    <p>Tree Testing !!!!!!
My name is Justin Mark Farrugia. I recently graduated with a degree in Business and Information Technology. I believed that design that is taught in most design schools, is close to art. Art raises questions, design is about making solutions. As a result, I taught myself the fundamentals of good design, I learnt about type, grids and what colors work well together. I still have a lot to learn, and I’m not stopping my education anytime soon.</p>

<p>My degree was valuable because it gave me business sensibility and taught me about what works and what doesn’t in different industries. It also enhanced my understanding of computer science and the showed me the building blocks of different concepts in machine learning and business intelligence. At heart however, I was always a designer. I liked both sides of the spectrum, these being the thought that goes behind a particular product and the idea of building a solution.</p>

<p>As I grow, one thing I learnt about great designers is that the only label they appreciate is ‘problem-solver’. I’m intrigued with not just collaborating with other designers or developers, which I’m hoping I’ll get to do more, but also design entreprenurship and the creative process. It’s not all about design though, I’m also a movie junkie, and a huge Manchester United fan. I should also mention that I’m an introspective person (I guess) who often spends a lot of time thinking, but I fully embrace the ethos of moving fast and geting shit done.</p>
