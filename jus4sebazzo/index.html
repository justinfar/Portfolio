                <strong>Dear Sebazzo,</strong>
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                Hey there! I’m Justin! Not sure if you remember me attending Hey Disco these past two years (awesome stuff btw) so let me give you a brief intro. A bit about me, I’m a twenty year old designer/developer (I like doing both) with a business degree (weird mix, I know). I love anything related to UX, UI, user-anything, and I'm getting pretty fluent in different technologies (HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, some Wordpress and Git along with some other cool stuff).
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I consider myself more of a designer but I'm open to learning pretty much anything that can help move both me and you guys forward. Anyways, the reason as to why I’m writing this is because I'm looking for a position, and I thought that a company like Sebazzo could be a great platform to grow.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>If there’s any questions that you’d like to ask, just feel free to reach out. You can do so either via reply to this email, calling me (prefer <a href="tel:+35699878998">SMS</a>) or just sending me a message via a social network (<a href="">Facebook</a>, <a href="">Twitter</a>, <a href="">Linkedin</a> take your pick). Anyways, really looking forward to hearing from you guys. Thanks for taking the time to read this!
            </p>
            <br>
        
<p>    <strong>Thanks,<br>
Jus
